## 1. What Does "RawNeural" Imply?
The word "Raw" suggests that the neural network is implemented in its most fundamental form, without the use of advanced frameworks or abstractions.
"Neural" refers to artificial neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data and learn patterns through training.

## RawNeural Implementation
#### Built from Scratch :
- The neural network is implemented using basic programming constructs and mathematical operations.
- No high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras are used.
- NumPy is likely used for matrix operations, as it is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.

#### Core Concepts Implemented Manually :
- Feedforward Propagation : The process of passing input data through the network to generate predictions.
- Backpropagation : The algorithm used to compute gradients and update the weights of the network during training.
- Weights and Biases : These are the parameters of the network that are learned during training.
- Optimization (Gradient Descent) : A method to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases.

#### Tested on Real-World Data :
- The neural network was tested on the Iris dataset , a classic dataset in machine learning used for classification tasks.
- The results indicate strong performance:
- Training Loss : 0.120, Training Accuracy : 98.3%
- Testing Loss : 0.147, Testing Accuracy : 96.7%
